        projectName: "Ultrasonic and Camera Based Parking Assistant System",
        description: "The proposed system is a deep learning-based parking assistant that aims to enhance the safety and convenience of parking for vehicles. The system utilizes YOLOv3, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to identify objects in the surroundings of the car. Additionally, the system integrates data from ultrasonic sensors and the car's camera to create a comprehensive map of the environment, which is then displayed on the car's dashboard. This prototype is a step towards the development of semi-autonomous vehicles, providing drivers with a more informed and assisted parking experience.",
